# Reusable Task Libraries in Prefect v3

### Support in Prefect v3

* **Modular Python Packages**: Prefect v3 centers around Python-native tasks and flows. You can define tasks in any Python module or package and import them into your flows. There is no special registry—tasks are regular functions decorated with `@task`.
* **Distribution**: Package your tasks as a standard Python library (e.g., with `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`) and publish to PyPI or a private index. Then `pip install your-task-library` in any project and import tasks normally.
* **Namespace Organization**: Group related tasks into logical namespaces (e.g., `mypkg.data`, `mypkg.ml`) so consumers can easily discover and import them.

### Best Practices

1. **Encapsulation & Single Responsibility**
   Each task should perform a single, well-defined operation (e.g., `download_data`, `preprocess_text`, `train_model`). This makes tasks composable and easier to test.

2. **Versioning & Semantic Release**
   Tag releases of your task library with [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Consumers can pin to a specific version to avoid breaking changes.

3. **Type Hints & Docstrings**
   Provide clear type annotations and docstrings. This improves IDE autocomplete and helps consumers understand inputs/outputs without reading implementation.

4. **Testing with `prefect.testing`**
   Write unit tests for each task using Prefect’s `flow_run` fixtures. Validate both success and failure modes.

5. **Configuration & Secrets**
   Externalize credentials and endpoints. Use `prefect.context.get_run_context().secrets` or environment variables, and avoid hardcoding.

6. **Documentation & Examples**
   Include a `README.md` with quick-start examples showing how to import and run tasks in a flow. Provide sample flow definitions.

7. **Dependency Isolation**
   If your library depends on heavy packages (e.g., `pandas`, `torch`), consider optional extras in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `yourpkg[ml]`) so consumers only install what they need.

8. **Artifact and Logging Conventions**
   Standardize how tasks emit artifacts (`create_table_artifact`, `create_markdown_artifact`) and log context to ensure consistency across flows.

9. **Maintenance & Support**
   Keep a changelog, monitor for issue reports, and periodically update dependencies to avoid security risks.

### Example Structure

```
my_task_library/
├── my_task_library/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_tasks.py   # download_data, transform_data
│   ├── model_tasks.py  # train_model, evaluate_model
│   └── utils.py        # shared helpers
├── tests/
│   ├── test_data_tasks.py
│   └── test_model_tasks.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

In your flow:

```python
from prefect import flow
from my_task_library.data_tasks import download_data
from my_task_library.model_tasks import train_model

@flow
def example_flow(url: str):
    data = download_data(url)
    model = train_model(data)
    return model
```

### When to Use

* **Team Collaboration**: Share common patterns across multiple flows or projects.
* **Consistency**: Enforce consistent data ingestion, validation, and reporting logic.
* **Maintenance**: Updates to core logic propagate automatically when the library is upgraded.

Packaging reusable task libraries is not only supported in Prefect v3 but is a recommended best practice for large-scale, multi-team projects.
