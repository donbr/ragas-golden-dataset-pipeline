# Prefect v3 Task Best Practices

When creating Prefect tasks, follow these rules:

1. Tasks should represent single logical steps of a workflow (keep them small and focused)
2. Always configure appropriate retries for tasks that interact with external services
3. Add proper retry_delay_seconds to all tasks with retries
4. Use tags to categorize tasks for better observability
5. Include detailed name and description for each task

Example of a well-configured task:

```python
@task(
    name="load-documents",
    description="Loads PDF documents from a directory using LangChain's PyPDFDirectoryLoader",
    retries=3,  
    retry_delay_seconds=60,
    tags=["data", "loading"]
)
def load_documents(path: str) -> List:
    """
    Load PDF documents from a directory using LangChain's PyPDFDirectoryLoader.
    
    Args:
        path: Directory path where files are located
        
    Returns:
        List of Document objects
    """
    # Implementation
```

Avoid creating tasks that are too large or do multiple logical operations. If a task does multiple things, split it into smaller tasks.
